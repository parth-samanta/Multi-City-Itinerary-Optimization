Project Description

This project aims to build a mixed-integer optimization model that automatically creates a multi-city holiday itinerary. The system selects cities to visit, sequences the travel route, and allocates stay durations for each destination.

The final plan is generated by solving a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that satisfies:

Budget Constraints: Total cost (stay + travel) must be within a fixed limit.

Time Constraints: Total trip duration (stay + travel time) must not exceed vacation days.

Route Feasibility: Ensures a valid tour starting and ending at "Home" without subtours.

Maximization: The model maximizes total "enjoyment" (utility) while penalizing excessive travel time.

Libraries Used

The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

CVXPY: For modeling the optimization problem.

NumPy: For numerical operations and matrix handling.

Matplotlib: For generating visualisations of the itinerary and budget allocation.

Note: The default solver used is ECOS_BB, which is bundled with CVXPY for mixed-integer problems.

Setup Instructions

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended).

2. Installation

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy cvxpy matplotlib


3. Project Structure

The project is organized as a Python package trip_opt. Ensure your directory looks similar to this:

/project_root
    /trip_opt
        __init__.py
        data.py       # Data generation and structures
        model.py      # CVXPY optimization model construction
        solver.py     # Solving logic and solution extraction
        analysis.py   # Text-based output of results
        viz.py        # Graph plotting functions
    run_example.py    # Main script to run a single optimization
    run_sensitivity.py # Script to run budget sensitivity analysis


Usage

Run a Single Optimization

To generate a synthetic dataset and solve for the optimal itinerary:

python run_example.py


This will print the itinerary details (route, stay days, costs) to the console and display two plots:

Stay Duration per City: Bar chart of days spent in selected cities.

Budget Allocation: Breakdown of stay costs, travel costs, and unused budget.

Run Sensitivity Analysis

To analyze how the optimal objective value changes with varying budget levels:

python run_sensitivity.py


This will generate a line graph showing the relationship between the available budget and the total enjoyment score.
